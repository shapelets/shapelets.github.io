                    Shapelets offers key accelerated analytics such as pattern recognition
                    (motifs and chains) and anomaly detection (discords) in a horizontal and scalable offer.

                    Shapelets’ algorithms allow you to establish a cause and effect relationship between
                    a collection of time series and an output in such way that you can explain linear relationships
                    between the inputs that cause an effect on the output.
