                <p>Shapelets reads data wherever it may be.
                    Retrieve streams of data from sensors, network logs,
                    web clickstreams, social media, etc. from systems such as:

                </ul>
                <p>
                    Shapelets can also ingest batch data at rest via Apache Drill from databases
                    and file systems like:

                    Shapelets acts as an intelligent distributed cache with write-through
                    and read-through behaviours.

                    Shapelets offers the possibility to act as your primary data source
                    not only for time series information but also for all the additional data

                    By using Shapelets Native Storage, you can reduce the complexity
                    of your production environment, by decommissioning existing servers,
                    licenses and additional production costs and resulting in a better ROI model.

                    When data storage is natively provided by Shapelets, external systems can still access
                    the data either through API calls, Shapelets Flow or, directly, through a standard
                    SQL-99 interface.

                    Shapelets is a distributed system where each node in the cluster provides the same
                    set of services like memory-centric APIs, durable store (if enabled), streaming and
                    execution services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shapelets Memory centric cluster works alongside different layers. The inner core is
                    a subset of the nodes that hold durable data (if enabled) and the outer layers can appear
                    and disappear on demand, This architecture minimises rebalancing data operations
                    whilst giving the ability to scale dynamically the number of computational and streaming nodes.

                <p>
                    The Shapelets ML engine executes algorithms moving the computation to the data.
                    When this is not possible, out engine assign tasks to make the best of the
                    resources available in a parallel fashion.

                    Shapelets offers a simple REST API so users can publish their analytics
                    into their custom time series visualizations tools.

                <p>
                    Business users, analysts and data scientists can use standard BI/analytics tools
                    such as Tableau, Qlik, MicroStrategy, Spotfire, SAS and Excel.
