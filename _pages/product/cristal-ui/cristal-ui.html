            INTERACTIVE TIME SERIES DATA VISUALIZATION
        </h2>
        <p>
            Our Business Intelligence interface quickly visualizes huge amounts of data,
            and allows you to filter, zoom, manipulate, and run analysis on it without writing
            any SQL statements or forcing you to reduce the size of your data sets.
        </p>
        <p>
            Time series is an inherently visual domain. Our Cristal UI treats time series data as
            first-class-citizen providing the dashboards and tools needed to gain unprecedented insights.

                    With the Cristal UI users can drag & drop sequences of data to zoom in
                    and out in realtime. All operations in a dashboard are executed in realtime,
                    automatically adjusting the number of points displayed on the UI without having
                    to aggregate or eliminate data. Users can move across series and interact with them
                    as charts synchronise during the exploration.
