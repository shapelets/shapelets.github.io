            Shapelets Flow is a distributed lambda architecture that captures custom algorithms
            and analytical flows, and combines any Python library (TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy...)
            with Shapelets algorithms.

                    New algorithms can be added and used by any major language through the DSL frontend,
                    regardless of its implementation language.

                    Each worker uses native libraries (NumPy, Pandas...) allowing full composition with existing solutions.
                    Use Jupyter Notebooks, Flask, Stream lit or any of your preferred environment without constraints.

                <p>
                    When new algorithms are ready, you can publish straight to our Crystal UI or your favourite BI tool.
                    Decision-makers can quickly solve business problems reducing the cost of deployment to zero.
